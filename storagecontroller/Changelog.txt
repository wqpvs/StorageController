1.0.8
- massive overhaul courtesy of Mister Andy Dandy!
   - new UI includes a search bar and scrollable inventory
   - just right click to get UI now
   - UI has a small refresh button, top right to update storage contents after taking/inserting
   - shift click or drag inventory into the storage controller input slots right from the main ui!
   - new graphics for linker and storage controller
   - left clicking with linker connects/disconnects to the controller, with highlighting
   - better highlighting of linked units
   - includes a new garbage bin! (just drag unwanted items on to the bin on the UI - careful they will instantly be destroyed!)
   - note stacks are now shown separately for stability reasons, when you click on a stack you will get the first stack of that type from inventory
       - you may not get the exact stack you clicked on - eg: 64 of clay stones and 12 of clay stones - click on one may give you the other


1.0.7
- show/highlight button - now shows range of device!
- mouse over text for inventory
- move large .afphoto out of assets (oops!)

1.0.6
- clear connections button
- connect nearby containers - with options? (Start & End coords maybe? Add commands?)

1.0.5
- fixing bugs introduced with the interface
- interface cannot be opened at the same time as the regular inventory

1.0.4
- Vintage Story 1.19.0 rc support
- You can control + right click on the storage controller to get a list of all items in the network
   - you can transfer one stack at a time by left clicking (shift+left clicking currently will just fail and give you ghost items)

1.0.3
- can now link storage controllers CTRL+LEFT Click with linker on a storage controller
- you can break a storage controller and have it maintain its link
   - note: if you want the controller to forget its settings then just recraft it with a linker tool
- new parts: storage controller upgrades!
   - you can upgrade from any lower tier direct to any upper tier with appropriate upgrade
   - eg: copper -> tinbronze, copper->cupronickel etc, iron->metoriciron, blackbronze->steel
   - you can't upgrade between the different bronzes though (so no tinbronze to blackbronze)
   - if the controller contains items it will drop them when you upgrade
